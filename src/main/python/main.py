from robot.write_gains import write_gains

# This is just to hopefully make the structure make a bit more sense, where write_gains is year-specific and is
# actually in the robot folder, which is intended to be year specific
# Also, this allows for other types of Python based testing and/or writing and/or generation to occur
# Honestly, it probably makes a bit less sense, though
